# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-using-R
The gradual decline in employee numbers is known as employee attrition. If your workforce shrinks over time, there will be employee attrition. In other words, workers are quitting more frequently than they are being hired.
There are a variety of causes for employee attrition. These include dissatisfaction with pay or benefit structures, a lack of opportunities for professional growth, and even poor working environments.

For this project, the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance datasetis used. We can analyze the behavioral patterns of the employees and predict the employee churn rate using the 1471 rows and 35 columns of information on their personal and employment details that this data set contains.
